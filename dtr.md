# DTR: Define the Relationship

**Project**: Romcom - Pair  
**Group Member Names**: Sue Wolf & Rachel Williams  

* **What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?**  
We're to learn & understand fundamentals as much as possible, and learning how best to collaborate.

* **What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?**  
We will mostly do pair programming so we can work together efficiently. When we get stuck, we will work independently to find answers and play around, then come together.

* **How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?**  
We will set up times to work through the project each day. We will communicate via slack for anything else. Make sure to consult your partner if you're going to make any changes.

* **How would you describe your work style?**  
We like to get full sections done at once but let's be mindful of when we need to call it.

* **What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?**
We're pretty good at communicating, so that should help us keep an open line of communication.

* **How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?**
We will use the iterations as a guide.

* **How will we overcome obstacles?**
Our standard is taking about 45 minutes to figure things out ourselves when we are stuck before asking for help. This can change depending on the specific issue.

* **What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?**
Good communication is key to being successful.

* **What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?**
We will start working about an hour after class gets out in most cases. We will start later when one of us has a regularly scheduled meeting.

* **What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?**
We both tend to give feedback when we feel it's needed. Sometimes we tiptoe around it, but we will try to be direct to each other.

* **What tools do you want to use to manage the project?**
We'll talk about using GitHub project board if needed. Since we will mostly be working through the project together, there may not be a need for that on this specific project.

* **How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?**
We generally like to post in Slack. If there is a call to discuss what we are stuck on, we will make sure we both join it, and that we're both included in whatever other help we receive.

* **How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?**
If the code is working and we understand it and can talk through it, we will be successful. After finishing an iteration, we will make sure we have enough time to finish the next iteration before starting it. We will be sure to set realistic goals and keep our focus on learning and understanding.

* **Additional Notes:**
Github Workflow Plans:
1. Use new branch for each iteration; detailed commits for every function
2. Alternate each day with who is the driver/navigator; always push to master at end of day
3. The next day, the other person will pull down code & create a branch for the day
