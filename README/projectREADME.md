## Learning Goals


* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the `new` keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS

## Overview

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well ... maybe that's true. We're going to make an app that generates romance novel covers!


## ROMCOM's official documention:
  - [DTR:](https://github.com/GreenbergKU/ROMCOM/blob/master/DTR.md) "Define the Relationship" for project. 
  - [Pull Request Template:](https://github.com/GreenbergKU/ROMCOM/blob/master/pull_request_template.md) image provided below)

## Additional LINKS
  - [Project ROMCOM website](https://greenbergKU.github.io/ROMCOM/) published on Github Pages.
  - [ROMCOM repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/ideabox-boilerplate): TURING's origonal project on GitHub.
  - [ROMCOM's Slack channel:](https://app.slack.com/client/T029P2S9M/C011E891RC1)(#private)


### Set Up
#### To begin, choose ONE PARTNER to do the following:
1. Fork this boilerplate repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. `cd` into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal
5. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository
#### Then, as a team:
* Explore the repository to see what's going on in the code
  - Look at each file: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `data.js`, `Cover.js`, `main.js`
  - _Note: no imports or exports are needed because each JS file is linked in the HTML_
  - Even if you don't know what each piece of the code is doing, talk through what you think is going on
* What pieces of code might you use to complete iterations, and what pieces will you have to create?
* All of your work will take place in `main.js` - you will not need to change any other files!

## Day 1 Deliverables

By the end of the day, complete the following tasks:
* As a team, read the entire project spec and rubric
* As a team, create a rough timeline to follow 
* As a team, create a public document for your DTR (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md))
* Make sure all teammates are added as collaborators to the forked repository
* Create a private Slack channel with all members of the project AND your assigned instructor and share links to:
  - the forked GitHub repo
  - the GitHub Pages deployed site
  - the DTR

## Progression
